# Pomodoro Timer
A simple **Python console-based study-break timer** built using the **Pomodoro Technique**.  
Stay focused during study sessions and take regular breaks to avoid burnout.
# How it works
- Set your study and break durations.
- The timer runs in the console using Python’s `time` module.
- You’ll be notified when it’s time to **work** or **rest**.
